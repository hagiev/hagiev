- 👋 Hi, I’m @hagiev
👀 I’m interested in the field of social sciences and understanding the complexities of human societies and cultures.

🌱 I’m currently learning about sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies to gain insights into social dynamics and promote social change.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to social justice, diversity, and community engagement to create a more inclusive and equitable society.

📫 If you're working on initiatives that address social issues or have ideas for positive social impact, let's connect and join forces.
